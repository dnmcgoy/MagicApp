    I have several goals while making this site. First, I didn't like
    any of the deck building sites out there, and thought I could make
    a cleaner and faster deck builder. Second, most deck building sites
    are within or surrounded by social site trappings, and don't tend to
    play nicely with competition. However, I'm not interested it building a
    community, merely with the rapid constucting of decks. I may build in
    mechanisms where others can critique a deck, or other semi-social
    features directly tied to deck building, but I also plan to export
    decks in various forum (auto-deck enabled, where possible) formats,
    and others formats where possible.

    Finally, this site is a testing ground for new ideas for me. This is
    my first site using ruby on rails, and my first site making extensive use
    of jquery. It might serve as the first in other things (mongodb, maybe?).
    My main purpose in stating this is that uptime will be
    worse than what my given host (currently heroku) provides, bugs and other
    errors will occur, and problems may or may not be fixed in a timely
    manner.
